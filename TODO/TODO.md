# TODO - AppliCare

1. password reset without manually entering the token -> meaning that the user just has to click on the link with the token.
2. creating the SECRET variable in the .env file for the jwt secret key -> openssl rand -base64 64 or 128. the current hardcoded one cant be used in production
3. cleaning up the frontend -> fixing the issues with global styles (index.css) and personal linked files like (Auth.css) for interfeering.
