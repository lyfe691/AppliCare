# TODO - AppliCare

1. [X] password hashing with bcrypt
2. [ ] password reset without manually entering the token -> meaning that the user just has to click on the link with the token.
3. [X] creating the SECRET variable in the .env file for the jwt secret key -> openssl rand -base64 64 or 128. the current hardcoded one cant be used in production
4. [ ] cleaning up the frontend -> fixing the issues with global styles (index.css) and personal linked files like (Auth.css) for interfeering.
5. [ ] keeping an eye on security config since ill need to change it for production.
6. [ ] make the error message in the auth forms look better
